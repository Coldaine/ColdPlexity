A production-ready, research-level Model Context Protocol (MCP) server providing AI-powered research capabilities. It interacts directly with the Perplexity website, offering intelligent search, persistent chat, and developer-focused tools without requiring an API key.

## ‚ú® Features

- üîç **Web Research**: Intelligent search and summarization via Perplexity's web interface without API limits.
- üí¨ **Persistent Conversations**: Maintain conversational context with a local SQLite chat history.
- üìÑ **Smart Content Extraction**: Extracts clean article content from URLs using Mozilla Readability and supports GitHub repository analysis.
- üõ†Ô∏è **Developer Tools**: Specialized tools for documentation retrieval, API discovery, and code deprecation analysis.
- üö´ **No API Keys Required**: Relies on robust web automation with Puppeteer, bypassing the need for paid API keys.
- üõ†Ô∏è **TypeScript-First**: A modern, type-safe, and maintainable codebase.
- üåê **Browser Automation**: Uses Puppeteer to interact with websites like a human, ensuring high-quality results.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Available

### 1. Search (`search`)
Performs a search query on Perplexity.ai. Supports `brief`, `normal`, or `detailed` response modes.
*   **Returns**: Raw text output of the search results.

### 2. Get Documentation (`get_documentation`)
Asks Perplexity to provide documentation and code examples for a technology, library, or framework, optionally focusing on a specific context.
*   **Returns**: Raw text output with documentation.

### 3. Find APIs (`find_apis`)
Asks Perplexity to find and evaluate APIs based on your specified requirements and context.
*   **Returns**: Raw text output listing and describing relevant APIs.

### 4. Check Deprecated Code (`check_deprecated_code`)
Asks Perplexity to analyze a code snippet for deprecated features within a specific technology (e.g., "React 18", "Node.js v20").
*   **Returns**: Raw text analysis of the code.

### 5. Extract URL Content (`extract_url_content`)
Extracts the main article text from any URL. It can also ingest entire GitHub repositories and recursively explore links up to a specified depth.
*   **Returns**: Structured JSON with content, title, and other metadata.

### 6. Chat (`chat_perplexity`)
Initiates or continues an ongoing conversation with Perplexity AI. Chat history is stored locally in `chat_history.db` for context.
*   **Returns**: A *stringified JSON object* containing the `chat_id` and the `response`.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Installation
> **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) installed.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/wysh3/perplexity-mcp-zerver.git
cd perplexity-mcp-zerver

# Install dependencies (this will also download a browser for Puppeteer)
pnpm install

# Build the server
pnpm run build
```
> **Important**: After building, it's recommended to restart your IDE (VS Code) or AI client application to ensure it picks up the new server.

### 2. Configuration

Add the server to your MCP configuration file. This file may be named `cline_mcp_settings.json`, `.cursor/mcp.json`, or `claude_desktop_config.json` depending on your client.

‚ö†Ô∏è **You must replace `/full/path/to/your/perplexity-mcp-zerver` with the absolute path on your system.**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "perplexity-server": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "/full/path/to/your/perplexity-mcp-zerver/build/main.js"
      ],
      "env": {},
      "disabled": false,
      "alwaysAllow": [],
      "autoApprove": [],
      "timeout": 300
    }
  }
}
```
*   **Windows Path Example**: `"C:\\Users\\YourUser\\Projects\\perplexity-mcp-zerver\\build\\index.js"`

### 3. Usage

Once the server is installed and configured, restart your AI client. You can then invoke the tools by name.

*   "Use `perplexity-server` to search for the latest news on large language models."
*   "Ask `perplexity-server` `get_documentation` about using async/await in TypeScript."
*   "Start a chat with `perplexity-server` about the pros and cons of server-side rendering."

## ü§î Why Use This Approach?

| Feature | Perplexity MCP Zerver | Traditional API Methods |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **API Keys** | ‚úÖ **None required** | ‚ùå Requires keys, costs, and rate limits |
| **Chat Persistence** | ‚úÖ Local & private SQLite DB | ‚ùå Often session-only or stored remotely |
| **GitHub Ingestion**| ‚úÖ Automatic repo analysis | ‚ùå Manual file handling required |
| **Privacy** | ‚úÖ **Everything runs locally** | ‚ùå Data is sent to third-party cloud services |

## üîß Troubleshooting

*   **Connection Issues**:
    1.  Double-check that the `args` path in your MCP JSON file is the **correct absolute path** to `build/index.js`.
    2.  Ensure the server is not `disabled` in the configuration.
    3.  Restart your IDE or AI client application completely.

*   **Useful Commands**:
    ```bash
    # Verify your Node.js installation path
    which node

    # Check that the build output file exists
    ls build/index.js

    # Rebuild the project if something seems broken
    pnpm run build
    ```
