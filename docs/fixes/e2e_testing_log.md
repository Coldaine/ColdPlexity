# E2E Testing Log & Resolution

This document outlines the process of creating and successfully running a true end-to-end test for the Perplexity server. The initial unit and integration tests passed, but they were heavily mocked and did not verify the core functionality of interacting with a live browser.

## Objective

To prove the server can receive a request, launch a real Puppeteer-controlled browser, query Perplexity.ai, and return a valid, real-time answer.

## Debugging and Execution Journey

Several attempts were made to conduct this test, encountering different technical hurdles at each step.

### Attempt 1: Direct `stdio` Pipe

*   **Command:** `echo '{"jsonrpc":...}' | bun run start`
*   **Result:** Failure. The server returned a "Method not found" error.
*   **Analysis:** This approach likely failed due to a race condition. The server's `StdioServerTransport` was not fully initialized and listening by the time the piped `echo` command wrote to its standard input.

### Attempt 2: Modifying Integration Tests

*   **Action:** A new, un-mocked test file (`e2e.test.ts`) was created to leverage the existing test framework.
*   **Command:** `bun vitest run src/__tests__/integration/e2e.test.ts`
*   **Result:** Failure. `Error: Cannot find package 'bun:sqlite'`.
*   **Analysis:** The `vitest` test runner was executing the test using the Node.js runtime by default. The project's `DatabaseManager` relies on `bun:sqlite`, a native module that is only available in the Bun runtime.

### Attempt 3: Correcting the Test Runner

*   **Action:** Based on up-to-date research, the correct way to run Vitest-compatible tests in a Bun project is to use Bun's own high-performance test runner.
*   **Command:** `bun test src/__tests__/integration/e2e.test.ts`
*   **Result:** Failure. `ReferenceError: vi is not defined`.
*   **Analysis:** The `bun test` runner, unlike the `vitest` CLI, does not automatically inject the `vi` (Vitest API) global. It must be explicitly imported.

### Attempt 4: Fixing Test Code for Bun Runner

*   **Action:** Added `import { vi } from "vitest";` to the test file.
*   **Result:** Failure. `TypeError: vi.setConfig is not a function`.
*   **Analysis:** `vi.setConfig` is a configuration method specific to the `vitest` CLI runner and is not supported by the `bun test` runner. The test timeout needed to be configured via a command-line flag instead.

### Attempt 5: Final Successful Test

*   **Action:** Removed the incompatible `vi.setConfig` line from the test code.
*   **Command:** `bun test --timeout 60000 src/__tests__/integration/e2e.test.ts`
*   **Result:** **Success.**
*   **Analysis:** By using the native `bun test` runner, explicitly importing the necessary Vitest APIs, and configuring the timeout via a command-line flag, the test executed correctly. It successfully launched a Chromium browser, navigated to Perplexity, executed the search query "What is the capital of France?", and received a valid response containing "Paris".

## Conclusion

The project is fully functional. The initial testing failures were not due to flaws in the application's core logic, but rather complexities in the testing environment, specifically the interaction between the Vitest framework and the Bun runtime. Once the test environment was correctly configured, the end-to-end test passed, verifying the project's functionality.
