# Code Review Summary

## Project Overview

This project is a server that uses Puppeteer to interact with Perplexity.ai without an API key. It exposes a set of tools through the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for tasks such as chatting with Perplexity, searching the web, extracting content from URLs, and finding documentation and APIs.

The project is well-structured, modular, and uses TypeScript. It includes unit and integration tests, and uses Biome for linting and formatting.

## Core Components

*   **`src/main.ts`**: The entry point of the application. It creates and starts the `PerplexityServer`.
*   **`src/server/PerplexityServer.ts`**: The core of the server. It initializes the MCP server, manages dependencies (BrowserManager, DatabaseManager, SearchEngine), and sets up tool handlers. It also handles graceful shutdown.
*   **`src/server/toolHandlerSetup.ts`**: This module is responsible for registering the tool handlers with the MCP server. It handles `ListTools` and `CallTool` requests, and includes error handling and timeouts.
*   **`src/schema/toolSchemas.ts`**: This file defines the schemas for all the available tools. The schemas are detailed and include descriptions, input/output schemas, examples, and other metadata.
*   **`src/tools`**: This directory contains the implementations of the various tools.
*   **`src/utils`**: This directory contains utility functions for logging, database interaction, and other tasks.
*   **`src/types`**: This directory contains the TypeScript type definitions.

## Functionality

The server appears to be functional. It's designed to be run as a standalone server that can be connected to by an MCP client. The use of Puppeteer allows it to interact with Perplexity.ai as if it were a user, bypassing the need for an official API key.

The tools provided cover a range of use cases, from simple web searches to more complex tasks like extracting content from URLs and finding APIs. The `chat_perplexity` tool allows for conversational interaction with Perplexity, and the server maintains chat history in a database.

## Strengths

*   **Modular Architecture**: The use of dependency injection and separate modules for different concerns makes the code easy to understand, test, and maintain.
*   **Well-Defined Tools**: The tool schemas are comprehensive and provide a clear definition of each tool's capabilities.
*   **Testability**: The project includes unit and integration tests, and the modular architecture makes it easy to write new tests.
*   **Good Documentation**: The code is well-commented, and the tool schemas serve as excellent documentation for the available tools.

## Potential Improvements

*   **Configuration**: The server configuration is hard-coded. It would be beneficial to use a configuration file or environment variables to manage settings like the server name, version, and other parameters.
*   **Error Handling**: While there is some error handling in place, it could be improved. For example, the server could provide more specific error messages to the client.
*   **Security**: The server uses Puppeteer to interact with the web, which can have security implications. It's important to ensure that the server is not vulnerable to injection attacks or other security risks.

## Conclusion

Overall, this is a well-written and functional project. It provides a useful set of tools for interacting with Perplexity.ai and the web, and it's designed in a way that is easy to understand, test, and maintain.
